# Custom Agent Template

> Canonical identity schema for all PAI agents — built-in and custom.
> Every agent is a full entity with name, backstory, personality, and visual identity.

## Template Usage

- **Built-in agents** (`~/.claude/agents/*.md`): Use this format for the persona section
- **Custom agents** (`~/.claude/custom-agents/*.md`): Use this format for the entire file
- **Dynamic agents** (ComposeAgent ephemeral): Generated prompts follow this structure

## Custom Agent vs Built-in Agent Differences

| Aspect | Built-in (`agents/*.md`) | Custom (`custom-agents/*.md`) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Location | `~/.claude/agents/` | `~/.claude/custom-agents/` |
| `custom_agent` field | Omitted | `true` |
| `created` field | Omitted | ISO date |
| `traits` field | Omitted | ComposeAgent trait keys |
| `source` field | Omitted | `"ComposeAgent"` or `"manual"` |
| Permissions | Full custom permissions block | Standard permissions (can customize) |
| `subagent_type` | Uses agent name (e.g., `Engineer`) | Always `general-purpose` |
| Lifecycle | Permanent, ships with PAI | User-managed (create/delete) |
